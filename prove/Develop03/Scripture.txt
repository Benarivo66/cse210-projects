John%3%16~For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life
Mosiah%2%17~And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God
James%1%5%6~If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering, for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
